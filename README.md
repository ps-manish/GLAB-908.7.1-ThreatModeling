# GLAB-908.7.1-ThreatModeling

## Introduction
Intro:
In this GitHub lab, learners will apply threat modeling concepts to a cloud-based web application scenario. They will identify potential security risks, prioritize them, and provide recommendations on how to mitigate these risks.

## Lab Overview
This scenario-based GitHub lab includes steps to create a diagram of the cloud-based web application's components, identify vulnerabilities, write code or configuration files to mitigate the vulnerabilities, and test the code or configuration files. The lab is expected to take approximately one hour to complete and will be evaluated based on the accuracy, completeness, and coherence of the learner's documentation, code, and collaboration with their team members.

### Steps:

- Set up a GitHub repository for this lab.
- Describe the purpose of a threat model and how it applies to this scenario in the readme.md file.
- Identify the assets, threats, and attack vectors associated with the cloud-based web application.
- Create a diagram that illustrates the different components of the cloud-based web application and how they are interconnected.
- Based on your diagram, identify potential vulnerabilities and prioritize them based on their severity.
- Write code or configuration files to implement secure coding practices to mitigate the identified threats.
- Test your code or configuration files to ensure that they effectively mitigate the identified threats.
- Document your findings and recommendations in the readme.md file.
- Include a section in the readme.md file that describes how your code or configuration files address the identified threats.
- Add a license file to your repository that specifies how others can use your code or configuration files.
- Use the Issues and Pull Requests features in GitHub to collaborate with your team members and review their code or configuration files.
- Submit your final code or configuration files and documentation to your instructor for review.

### Sample Solution:

- [ ] In the readme.md file, explain the purpose of a threat model and how it applies to this scenario.
- [ ] Create a diagram that illustrates the different components of the cloud-based web application and how they are interconnected using a tool like Lucidchart.
- [ ] Identify potential vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and authentication vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Prioritize the vulnerabilities based on their severity.
- [ ] Write a script in Python that implements secure coding practices to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. 
For Example, the script could sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and use secure password storage techniques to prevent authentication vulnerabilities.

- [ ] Test the script to ensure that it effectively mitigates the identified vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Document the findings and recommendations in the readme.md file, including a section that describes how the
- [ ] Python script addresses the identified vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Add an MIT license file to the repository to specify how others can use the Python script.
- [ ] Use the Issues and Pull Requests features in GitHub to collaborate with your team members and review their code.
- [ ] Submit the final Python script and documentation to your instructor for review.
